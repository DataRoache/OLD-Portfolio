# Portfolio
Collection of analytical work and projects I've done.

1) The "Jedi Plumbing" folder showcases a Python webscraping project and Excel interactive dashboard.

2) The "SQL, PowerBI Sales Analysis" folder represents work I've done in SQL and PowerBI to analyze and visualize a large sales dataset that I sourced from data.world.

3) The Ad-Based Revenue project is work I did for a fictional company with fictional data, to create KPI reports. Used a little bit of SQL, and a lot of PBI.

  2) dataset found here:
