Here we see the 2 query files I have created for this project.

The most important and main file, titled "SalesDataQueries", is simply data exploration. It answers all of the questions posed in the business demands Word file.
  - Makes use of most basic SQL syntax like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUPBY, ORDERBY, JOIN...to more advanced SQL topics like CTE's, Temp Tables, Views, Subqueries & Window Functions.

The second file, titled "SalesTableViewQuery", is used to prepare the data I needed to visualize in a View, which I then brought up in PowerBI.
